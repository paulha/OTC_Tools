_welcome to the JIRA tools scripting sandbox!_
authors: Paul Hanchett, Josh Wilcox, Robert "BJ" Beatty

- Now requires Python 3.5 or greater to run

- Can be installed onto a machine and run as

        python -m jira_tools <command>

## Available Commands
#### help
Lists out available commands and switches.

#### compare_priorities

#### dump_parents

#### e_feature_scanner

## Log Files
There are three _cumulative_ log files
generated by jira_tools and placed into the CWD
when the command is run. They are

- otc_tool.log (_All output is logged here_)
- otc_tool_errors.log (_Only errors are written here_)
- otc_tool.dat (_A general purpose data file_)

## Logging configuration file
The logging configuration file is named logging.yaml 
and may be in the `CWD` or in the same directory 
as `otc_tool.py`.

## Login credentials and server URL
Login credentials are held in `config.yaml`. `Config.yaml`
may be located in either the CWD or it can be placed
into `~/.jira/` located in the user's home directory.

A sample `config.yaml.example` is provided in the 
`jira_tools` subdirectory.

There are multiple sections to this file. If no target 
server is specified, the **default** section will be used.

An alternate section can be used by specifying a name switch 
on the command line:

        python -m jira_tools e_feature_scanner --name <server>

See the example file for more detailed information.

## Queries file
The queries file contains templated JQL statements used 
by the various commands in jira_tools. This provides an 
easy way to correct a query or perform a custom query
without reprogramming the tool. (It isn't intended as
a way to signifincantly change functionality: it would
be better to add a new command to do that!)

The queries file (`queries.yaml`) is nominally located 
in the jira_tools directory. A `queriea.yaml` 
file in the CWD will receive preference over the built-in 
query file.
